<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project



ENVIPEACE JUNIOR is a cross platform mobile application which is aiming to sensitize children towards the environment through interactive educational content.

This Project was designed during the Moroccan IOT and AI challenge where this last wons the third national prize.

The application contains three main rubrics:
* quizzes 
* Let's code
* Training

## What are the technologies used for this project ?

This Project was built using [JavaScript] as a programming language and the following technologies:
* [ReactNative]
* [NodeJs]
* [Firebase]




<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## What are the challenges faced while building this application?

We did the first version of this application using expo. The application has been so slow and after some real research on this topic, there are some tips to maximize the performance of your ReactNative application:

* Cache images and videos before using them (you can use react-native-f's)
* Don't forget to delete all the console.log before publishing the application.
* Use Memoization: for classes -> use React.PureComponent instead of normal components, for functions -> use React.memo
* This library allows you to load images more quickly: react-native-fast-image
* Enable Hermes (A JS engine to optimize app start time, reduce APK size, and memory footprints)

Keep in mind that all those libraries can only be used while using react-native cli they are not figuring yet among expo libraries :)

### What I've learned from this project ?


* React-Native framework
* NodeJs Api calls
* How To use android studio and sdk
* How filesystem works on react native and how to use react-native-fs to cache files .
